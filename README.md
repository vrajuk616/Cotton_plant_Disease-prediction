# Cotton_plant_Disease-prediction
I developed “🌿Cotton Plant Disease Prediction & Get Cure App” using Artificial Intelligence especially Deep learning

I just took baby step and start to collect lots of images of cotton crop plants from my farm. To collect accurate data we need expertise in that domain and as a farmer it help me a lot.

Then I decide which algorithm is best to solve this problem and I select as usual you know “Convolution Neural Network” (CNN). I create my own CNN architecture and it works well on the training and as well as testing dataset.

It gives me more than 98% accuracy on training and validation data set in just 500 epochs. I am trying to increase accuracy with more data and epochs.
